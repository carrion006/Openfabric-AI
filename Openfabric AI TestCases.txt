Openfabric AI TestCases:

This is a high-level overview of potential test cases. Specific test cases will depend on the specific module or feature being tested.

1. Functional Testing

1.1. Consensus Protocol

Positive scenarios:
Verify that nodes can join and leave the network without disrupting consensus.
Verify that the dynamic consensus mechanism reaches consensus on different types of decisions with varying importance levels.
Verify that the system recovers from Byzantine faults.
Negative scenarios:
Simulate node failure and verify that the system can continue to operate.
Inject malicious nodes into the network and verify that they are identified and isolated.
Verify that the system is resistant to denial-of-service attacks.
1.2. AI-Apps

Positive scenarios:
Verify that users can deploy and run AI-Apps on the network.
Verify that AI-Apps can interact with each other and exchange data.
Verify that AI-Apps can access and process data stored on the network.
Negative scenarios:
Verify that malicious AI-Apps are identified and prevented from running.
Verify that the system can handle invalid or faulty AI-Apps.
Verify that the system can recover from AI-Apps that crash or become unresponsive.
1.3. Openfabric AI Xplorer

Positive scenarios:
Verify that users can browse and search for AI-Apps.
Verify that users can deploy and run AI-Apps through the Xplorer.
Verify that users can rate and review AI-Apps.
Negative scenarios:
Verify that the Xplorer can handle invalid or missing data.
Verify that the Xplorer can recover from network errors.
Verify that the Xplorer is resistant to common web vulnerabilities.
1.4. Openfabric Community AI Apps

Positive scenarios:
Verify that users can use the apps to generate text, images, music, and QR codes.
Verify that the apps are easy to use and understand.
Verify that the apps are accessible to users with different levels of technical expertise.
Negative scenarios:
Verify that the apps can handle invalid or missing input.
Verify that the apps are resistant to malicious input.
Verify that the apps do not generate offensive or harmful content.
2. Performance Testing

Measure the throughput and latency of the network under different loads.
Measure the response time of the AI-Apps.
Measure the resource utilization of the network nodes.
3. Security Testing

Identify potential vulnerabilities in the smart contracts.
Test the system for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
Perform a penetration test to identify any exploitable weaknesses.
4. Usability Testing

Test the usability of the Openfabric AI Xplorer and the Openfabric Community AI Apps.
Gather feedback from users on the ease of use and understandability of the interfaces.
Make adjustments to the interfaces based on user feedback.
5. Decentralization Testing

Verify that the network is resistant to censorship and single points of failure.
Measure the degree of decentralization of the network.
Explore ways to further decentralize the network.
6. Data Privacy Testing

Verify that user data is stored securely and only accessed with appropriate permissions.
Test the system for compliance with data privacy regulations.
Develop mechanisms for users to control their data.
7. Regulation Testing

Verify that the Openfabric AI platform complies with relevant regulations.
Explore potential regulatory challenges and develop solutions to address them.
Stay up-to-date on changes in regulations and adapt the platform accordingly.
